I am a first-year PhD student at MIT ORC advised by Professor Rahul Mazumder.
I graduated Cornell in 2020 with a B.S. in Operations Research and I worked at
Microsoft as a data scientist from 2020 to 2021.

I am broadly interested in the intersection of optimization and
statistical machine learning.
