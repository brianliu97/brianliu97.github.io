I am a third-year PhD candidate at the Operations Research Center at MIT where I am advised by Professor Rahul Mazumder. I work at the intersection of statistical machine learning and discrete optimization and develop methods to make popular ML algorithms interpretable. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a Data and Applied Scientist at Microsoft in Redmond.
