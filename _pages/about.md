I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at the Operations Research Center at MIT where I am advised by Professor Rahul Mazumder. I work at the intersection of statistical machine learning and discrete optimization and develop methods to make ML algorithms interpretable. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a Data and Applied Scientist at Microsoft. 

Please find my CV [here](files/cvbrian.pdf).
